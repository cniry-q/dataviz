Data Visualization
==================

This repo was created for Dataviz_ project from NewCoder_ website.
I thought that it will contain some tasks/challenges to solve and I
wanted to practice some in using github, that's why it was created.
I found an examples and detailed explanaitons related to topic
and no actual tasks.

However, Dataviz_ project ends with Extended_ section which inspired me
to create a script_ for visualizing CSV data downloadable from WorldBank_
website. This helped me to learn many new stuff.

I want to say a big **Thank you** NewCoder_ website!
